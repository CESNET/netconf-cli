Why don\u0027t they call it \"uninitialized value\"? Please ask them if there\u0027s a better way of doing this.\n- It\u0027s a unit test where using SECTION like this is a common idiom. If you insist, please disable this test for everything below test/ .\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the CI runs everything with ASAN and UBSAN. Are you sure this particular check adds value?",
