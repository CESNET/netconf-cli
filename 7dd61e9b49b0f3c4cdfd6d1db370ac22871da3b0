      "message": "This feels wrong -- executing \"actions\" via the \"rpc\" command. I\u0027m not sure how to do it in the least confusing way, but what about calling this \"exec-prepare\" or \"prepare\"? That way, the \"exec\" command could work by either executing whatever is prepared already, or it would also support a new way of executing stuff which only makes sense for those RPCs/actions with no input parameters:\n\n /\u003e exec /ex:interfaces[name\u003d\u0027eth0\u0027]/shutdown\n Action executed.\n /\u003e exec /ex:clock/set-time\n Error: mandatory parameters for RPC not set.\n Hint: try `prepare /ex:clock/set-time`.\n /\u003e prepare /ex:clock/set-time\n (RPC /ex:clock/set-time)\u003e ls\n time\n (RPC /ex:clock/set-time)\u003e set time \"12:34:56\"\n (RPC /ex:clock/set-time)\u003e exec\n RPC executed.\n /\u003e prepare /ex:launch-nukes\n (RPC /ex:shoot)\u003e set target \u0027Brno\u0027\n (RPC /ex:shoot)\u003e execute\n RPC output:\n yield \u003d 666\n /\u003e\n\nFeel free to open a task for this rework (and implement that later on).",
