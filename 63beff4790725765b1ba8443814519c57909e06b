On line 256, the default constructor of std::optional\u003cT\u003e is called, which means that that variable cannot be possibly uninitialized (unless I\u0027m wrong about some assumptions about exception handling).\n\nI think that the only chance of a possible \"weird\" behavior is the case of std::optional\u003cstd::string_view\u003e::operator\u003d throwing, but if I\u0027m reading https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/operator%3D#Exceptions correctly, and because string_view\u0027s operator\u003d is noexcept, to me this looks like a valgrind false positive.",
