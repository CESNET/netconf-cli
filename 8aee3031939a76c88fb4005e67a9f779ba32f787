      "message": "Hmmm. This is a good change of course, but given the context in which I saw it (https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/netconf-cli/+/2488/6..7/src/static_schema.cpp where it got changed from \u003d\u003d to !\u003d), I went to investigate test coverage:\n\n- splitModuleNode is now never called without a \u0027:\u0027,\n- availableNodes() never hits line 159.\n\nThis looks fishy -- can you take a look, please?",

      "message": "1) it is never called without a colon, because all paths in StaticSchema are stored with the prefix. I\u0027ll change the return statement to a throw statement.\n2) it never hits that line, because availableNodes with a module argument is only used for the output of the ls command and I don\u0027t test that. So maybe I should just throw there?",
