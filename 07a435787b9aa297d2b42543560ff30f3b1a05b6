      "message": "I always split lines like this because of line length, but now, my screen do around 230 chars, so 120~ characters is fine by me. I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s an improvement, but there is no real reason for this line to be split like before. I\u0027m kinda looking forward to C++20 and the Ranges library. Hopefully it will then look something like this:\nstd::transform(childrenRef, res, [](auto it) { return it.first; });\nwhich is pretty clear to me on a single line. The current line is the same only with more boilerplate, and the code is really only the lambda.",
