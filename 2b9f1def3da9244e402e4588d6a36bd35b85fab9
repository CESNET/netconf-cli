      "message": "The reason I made a switch candidate is that my app depends on the candidate datastore. The reason commit is now needed when copying config is because I copy startup to candidate (because I switched from running to candidate). And to really copy to running I need to commit.\n\nI think the candidate datastore is kind of weird because you really can\u0027t switch into it, it\u0027s just a workplace where you edit values. So candidate could be either startup-candidate or running-candidate depending on what your actice DS is.",
