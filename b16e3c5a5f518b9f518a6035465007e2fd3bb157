      "message": "From this snippet, I do not understand how the class is going to be used. I have not written the code, so I do not know, but I can imagine a few very different scenarios:\n\n- perhaps it dumps me all possible key/value pairs for the latest list in the path,\n- hmm, but it\u0027s a set, that\u0027s weird, why is not indexed by the key name, i.e. a map\u003cstring, set\u003cstring\u003e\u003e?\n- does it really work on just the last list, then? What about a /foo:foo[k1\u003d5]/bar[k2\u003d6]?\n- I see it takes a data path, not a schema path now. How does it handle \"partial indexing\", i.e. scenarios where paths specify just a subset of all keys for a given list?\n\nSo, this needs more:\n\n- docs,\n- test coverage",
