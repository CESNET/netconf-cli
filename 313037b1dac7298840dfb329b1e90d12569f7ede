I don\u0027t think there\u0027s too much code, but for example, the part where it tries to find the executables could be a function called `setup_sysrepo` or something. I think that would make it more readable",

      "message": "Well, it\u0027s CMake :(. I wanted to move that code here because I do not want to output a STATUS message \"yeah, we\u0027re gonna do tests\" and fail later on, which means that this gets long. I remember first implementing these three-state options back in 2013? for Trojita. Actually, reviewing someone\u0027s Google Summer of Code contribution which implemented something like that. I\u0027m quite disappointed that there\u0027s *still* no generic solution upstream.\n\nhttps://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/netconf-cli/+/3250",
