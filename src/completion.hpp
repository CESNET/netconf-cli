     * the ParserContext. For example, let's say there are two valid schema paths: "user/name", "user/nationality" and "user/city" and the
     * user tries to complete this path: "user/n". The parser determines these completions: "name", "nationality", "city". The parser
     * filters out "city", because it doesn't start with an "n", so valid completions are "name" and "nationality". Their common prefix is
     * "na", so the input becomes "user/na". Next, the user changes the output to "user/natio", the completions will again be "name",
     * "nationality", "city", but now, after filtering, only one single completion remains - "nationality". This is where m_suffix gets in
     * play: since there is only one completion remaining, m_suffix can get added depending on the value of m_whenToAdd. It it's set to
     * Always, the suffix gets appended always. That means, the actual completion would be "nationality" plus whatever m_suffix is set to.
     * Otherwise (if m_whenToAdd is set to IfFullMatch), the suffix will only get added after the user input fully matches the completion.
     * For example, if the user input is "user/natio", the completion becomes just "nationality", but if the user input is "user/nationality",
     * the completion becomes "nationality" plus the suffix.
