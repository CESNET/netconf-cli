      "message": "I understand, but I think this should be changed. Now that the code was extended and the \"real\" YangSchema can and does return RPCs (and others), it makes sense to extend the StaticSchema with support for at least the RPCs as well. It could be very simple:\n\n StaticSchema s;\n s.addRpc(\"/example:launch-nukes\");\n s.addContainer(\"/example:launch-nukes/input\");\n s.addLeaf(\"/example:launch-nukes/input/megatons\", ...);\n s.addContainer(\"/example:launch-nukes/output\");\n s.addLeaf(\"/example:launch-nukes/output/mushroom-cloud-height\", ...);\n\nI think it\u0027s OK to keep the \"special containers\" \"input\" and \"output\" as they are in libyang. The downside is that callers would have to know how to work with them, but the advantage is that one can use availableNodes() to query RPC\u0027s input and output parameters. An alternative would be making this explicit via two new methods, inputNodes(std::string path) and outputNodes(std::string path).\n\nAre you OK with making this change in the StaticSchema?",

      "message": "This seems like a weird idea, to support any more of rpc stuff right now. The support is mainly driven by what the parser supports. So to support something I need to extend the parser AST with structs like `rpc_`. If I implemented what you suggest, it would mean adding something, that isn\u0027t really a feature. The entire Add more types to YangSchema::nodeType change is about adding the least amount of stuff, so that my node parser rework can work. Imho it makes little sense to add any more support just so that we can be sure that the code here really ignores rpcs/leaflist/whatever. I\u0027m fine with adding a FIXME here that will be resolved when support for rpcs/leaflist/whatever gets added.",
