This change was needed because StaticSchema now does absolute paths with a leading slash, so I had to account for that case. Maybe I should put that into the commit message.\n\nThis function is used throughout at least the leaf_editing test. Testing this function would mean testing the StaticSchema class, which is used for testing.",
